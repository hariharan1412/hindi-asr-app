# Project Description: Hindi ASR FastAPI Application

This document outlines the development of a FastAPI-based Python application for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) using NVIDIA NeMo. It covers the core functionalities, key challenges encountered and their resolutions, and important considerations regarding the current deployment and future enhancements.

## 1. Successfully Implemented Features

The following core features and functionalities have been successfully implemented:

* **Core ASR Endpoint:** We developed a robust **FastAPI `POST /transcribe` endpoint** that accepts `.wav` audio files and returns the transcribed Hindi text in a structured JSON format. This provides a complete, functional ASR service.

* **NVIDIA NeMo Model Integration:** The application seamlessly integrates the **`stt_hi_conformer_ctc_medium` ASR model** from NVIDIA NeMo. The model loads correctly, handling device placement to ensure it runs efficiently on the target environment. The initial setup and testing of the native NeMo model are covered in the `nemo_model_test.py` script.

* **ONNX Model Optimization & Inference:** The NeMo model was successfully **exported to the ONNX format**, optimizing it for inference. This optimization process is handled by the `export_onnx.py` script. The inference pipeline then uses **ONNX Runtime** (demonstrated in `onnx2ctc.py`) to execute predictions, delivering enhanced performance and reduced overhead compared to native PyTorch inference, specifically targeting CPU-only environments using `CPUExecutionProvider`.

* **Comprehensive Audio Preprocessing:** A robust audio preprocessing pipeline was implemented. This includes:
    * Dynamic **resampling to 16kHz**, which is the required sample rate for the NeMo model.
    * Conversion of **stereo audio to mono** to standardize input.
    * **Audio duration validation** that clips longer audio clips to 10 seconds, aligning with the model's optimal 5-10 second range and ensuring predictable latency.
    * Leveraging the **NeMo model's built-in preprocessor** to transform raw audio into the specific Mel-spectrogram features required by the ONNX model. The logic for this preprocessing and subsequent CTC decoding is centralized within the `onnx2ctc.py` script for optimized inference.

* **Custom CTC Decoding & Tokenization:** We implemented the **greedy CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) decoding logic** to accurately convert the raw logit outputs from the ONNX model into predicted token IDs. The **NeMo model's tokenizer** was then used to convert these numerical IDs into human-readable Hindi text. This decoding logic is also part of the `onnx2ctc.py` script.

* **Docker Containerization:** The entire application, including all dependencies and the ASR model, is packaged into a portable Docker image using a comprehensive **Dockerfile**. The container starts the FastAPI server on **port 8000**, following **best practices** like using a `python:3.10-slim-buster` base image and layered instructions for efficient builds to achieve a lightweight image size.

* **Asynchronous Request Handling:** The FastAPI application, powered by Uvicorn, is designed to efficiently handle **concurrent requests**. The `POST /transcribe` endpoint is defined as `async def`, allowing Uvicorn to manage multiple incoming requests concurrently. This ensures that while one request's model inference is running, other requests can still be received and processed, preventing the server from blocking.

## 2. Issues Encountered During Development

Developing this application presented valuable learning opportunities and challenges:

* **Complex Environment Setup and Dependency Management:**
    * **Issue:** Getting a fully compatible development environment with NeMo, PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, and various audio processing libraries (`soundfile`, `resampy`, `pydub`) proved intricate due to specific version requirements and underlying system dependencies (`ffmpeg`, `sox`). This was particularly challenging to ensure consistency within the Docker build.
    * **Resolution:** We addressed this through meticulous dependency management via `requirements.txt`, iterative refinement of the Dockerfile to pinpoint and install necessary system packages, and careful validation of each component during the build process.

* **ONNX Model Export and Inference Mismatch:**
    * **Issue:** While exporting the NeMo model to ONNX was straightforward, mapping its exact input/output tensor expectations for `onnxruntime` inference required careful attention. The primary challenge was realizing the ONNX model expected *preprocessed features* (`audio_signal`, `length`) rather than raw audio waveforms, and correctly interpreting the `blank_id` for CTC decoding from the ONNX output.
    * **Resolution:** This was resolved by thoroughly inspecting the NeMo model's internal processing graph and the ONNX model's input/output definitions. The inference script (`onnx2ctc.py`) was refined to explicitly use the `asr_model.preprocessor` and `asr_model.tokenizer` from NeMo, ensuring precise alignment of features and tokenization, and dynamically determining the `blank_id` based on the ONNX output's dimension.

* **SentencePiece Tokenizer `RuntimeError` with NumPy Integers:**
    * **Issue:** A subtle but critical error occurred during the final CTC decoding step. Passing a list of token IDs (which were originally NumPy integers from `np.argmax`) to the NeMo tokenizer's `ids_to_text` method resulted in a `RuntimeError: unknown output or input type` from the underlying `sentencepiece` library.
    * **Resolution:** The `sentencepiece` library, which NeMo's tokenizer relies on, specifically expects standard Python `int` types, not NumPy's integer types. The solution involved explicitly casting each NumPy integer ID to a Python `int` (e.g., `decoded_ids.append(int(token_id_numpy))`) before compiling the list of `decoded_ids` and passing it to the tokenizer.

* **Debugger Warnings with Frozen Modules:**
    * **Issue:** During development, recurring `Debugger warning: It seems that frozen modules are being used, which may make the debugger miss breakpoints` messages appeared. While not fatal to the application, these indicated potential debugging reliability issues.
    * **Resolution:** This is a known behavior with certain Python debugger configurations or optimized Python installations. Though it didn't impede core functionality, it was noted as an area for potential future refinement of the development environment or debugger settings to enhance the debugging experience.

## 3. Unimplemented Components, Limitations, and Future Overcoming Strategies

The current deployment is a solid foundation, but like any project, it has areas for future expansion and considerations for more complex production scenarios.

### Components Not Implemented (by Design or Current Scope):

* **Advanced Asynchronous Model Execution:** While the FastAPI application handles requests asynchronously, the underlying ONNX Runtime model inference is a synchronous, CPU-bound operation. For the specified 5-10 second audio clips, this is an efficient and pragmatic choice. However, for extreme scale or GPU-based inference, truly non-blocking, asynchronous model execution would be beneficial.
* **Real-time Streaming ASR:** The current design focuses on processing complete, finite audio clips. It doesn't support continuous, real-time audio streams, which would require stateful processing and incremental transcription.
* **Multi-language Support:** The application is specifically configured with the `stt_hi_conformer_ctc_medium` model, limiting transcription to the Hindi language as per the assignment's explicit requirement.
* **Broader Audio Codec Support:** While `.wav` files are handled robustly (including variations via `ffmpeg`), direct support for other audio codecs (e.g., MP3, FLAC) without an explicit pre-conversion step isn't natively integrated into the core inference pipeline.
* **Authentication/Authorization:** The `/transcribe` endpoint is currently publicly accessible, lacking any security measures.
* **Advanced Observability:** The deployment currently lacks comprehensive logging, metrics collection, or monitoring integration, which are crucial for production environments.

### How These Challenges/Limitations Will Be Overcome in Future Iterations:

* **Scaling Advanced Asynchronous Inference:** For high-throughput scenarios or GPU utilization, we'd offload model prediction by:
    * Using FastAPI's **`BackgroundTasks`** for very short, non-critical background jobs.
    * Integrating a dedicated **message queue (e.g., Celery, RabbitMQ)** and a worker pool to process transcription requests asynchronously, returning results via webhooks or polling.
    * Leveraging specialized **model serving frameworks (e.g., NVIDIA Triton Inference Server)** designed for high-performance, asynchronous, and GPU-accelerated inference.
* **Implementing Real-time Streaming ASR:** This would involve adopting streaming-capable ASR models (e.g., RNN-T) and implementing **WebSocket communication** in FastAPI. The backend would need to manage state for each active stream, processing audio chunks incrementally for live transcription.
* **Expanding Language Support:** This could be achieved by either integrating multiple ASR models (one per language) with a language detection or selection mechanism, or by utilizing a suitable multilingual ASR model.
* **Enhanced Audio Codec Support:** A dedicated audio conversion microservice or deeper integration of `ffmpeg-python` could preprocess diverse audio formats into a consistent `.wav` format before ASR.
* **Security Integration:** Implement **FastAPI's built-in security features**, such as OAuth2 with JWT tokens or API Key authentication, to secure the endpoint.
* **Improved Observability:** Integrate structured logging (e.g., `Loguru`) for detailed request/inference information, expose Prometheus metrics for monitoring performance, and consider distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) for complex deployments.

## 4. Known Limitations and Assumptions of Current Deployment

* **Input Audio Format:** The primary expectation is for `.wav` audio files. While there's some robustness, non-WAV inputs will generally require external conversion.
* **Audio Duration:** Audio clips longer than 10 seconds will be clipped. This ensures consistent latency and resource usage per request, aligning with the model's optimal input range.
* **Resource Usage:** The current deployment is optimized for **CPU-only inference**. While efficient, very high throughput or extremely low latency demands would necessitate GPU-based inference or horizontal scaling across more CPU cores.
* **Model Specificity:** The application is limited to Hindi language transcription as it uses a Hindi-specific ASR model.
* **Stateless Processing:** Each `/transcribe` request is processed independently; no session management or user context is maintained across requests.
* **Ephemeral Logs:** Logs generated within the Docker container are ephemeral unless explicit volume mounting or external logging services are configured.
* **No High Availability/Load Balancing:** The current setup is a single container. For a production environment, it would require deployment behind a load balancer with multiple replicas for high availability and distributed load.
